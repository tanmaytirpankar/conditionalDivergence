# Testing Control-Flow Divergence in Programs with Floating-Point Conditionals

Coming up with ideas to help understand, detect, and solve control-flow divergence in programs containing floating-point 
conditionals.

## What is control-flow divergence?

## Installation

Create a build directory and run cmake from it:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

Run programs

```bash
./conditional_with_literal
./conditional_with_binOp
```
